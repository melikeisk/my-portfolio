              In 2023, I started studying web design and coding, where I began
              writing code. I am focusing on improving my skills in Front-End
              development. I enjoy coding and creating web designs.
              Additionally, I have an interest in areas such as data science and
              pixel art. Trying out different things is like playing a fun game
              for me, and I really enjoy it.

              Philosophy and psychology are my other areas of expertise. Before
              starting coding, I was a teacher. Philosophy helped me understand
              myself, while psychology assisted me in understanding others.

              I create paintings using the acrylic pouring technique. By freely
              pouring and interacting colors with each other, I craft unique and
              captivating patterns. Additionally, playing the kalimba is a
              passion of mine; I enjoy expressing my emotions and nourishing my
              soul with this melodic instrument.

                <p>Have you ever seen Google's 1998 beta version? If you haven't, then it means you haven't experienced the simple yet effective state of the internet at that time. But don't worry, I've recreated it exactly for you. This beta version sheds light on the period when Google was still a young and evolving technology as a search engine. The web page had a minimalist design, and unlike today's complex search algorithms, the search results were quite basic and straightforward. However, since then, Google has continuously improved the search experience and added innovations to make users' lives easier. Google's 1998 beta version offers an intriguing flashback when considering how far we've come, serving as a significant indicator of how the internet has evolved.</p>
